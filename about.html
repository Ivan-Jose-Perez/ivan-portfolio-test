            <p>Hello! I'm a seasoned Cybersecurity professional, a dedicated Cybersecurity student, and a proud Marine Corps Veteran. Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm a HAM Radio enthusiast, a father to three wonderful children, and a self-proclaimed nerd at heart. My interests extend beyond the digital world; I find joy in hiking, exploring the great outdoors, and experimenting in the kitchen to make healthy food delicious. My multifaceted journey reflects my passion for technology, commitment to family, and a relentless quest for knowledge.</p>

            <p>My story begins in Santa Maria, CA, a humble town where I initially worked in the agriculture industry during high school. Seeking to expand my horizons, I enlisted in the Marine Corps' Communication Technology field. This decision opened doors to a world of opportunities, allowing me to travel and delve into various IT domains including radio, network, satellite, and data operations. My drive to learn and grow led me through multiple internships, culminating in a fulfilling career in the cybersecurity industry. This path has been one of continuous exploration and discovery.

            </code></pre>
            <p>Today, I stand as a committed cybersecurity professional, steadily advancing towards completing my bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I am also enriching my technical skill set through the Full Stack Academy Bootcamp, where I am learning to integrate coding into my cybersecurity expertise. This journey is not just about acquiring new skills but also about adapting and evolving in an ever-changing digital landscape.
